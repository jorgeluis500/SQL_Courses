-- On September 25th (2013) we started giving customers the option to add a 2nd product while on the /cart page.

-- Compare the month before vs the month after the change
-- Iâ€™d like to see CTR (Clickthrough) from the /cart page, Avg Products per Order, AOV (Average order value), and overall revenue per /cart page view.

-- STEP 1 -- Select sessions with cart sessions
-- STEP 2 -- Join the cart sessions with all the pageviews table on website session and the pageviews higher than the cart pageview number
-- STEP 3 -- Next, give me the page that came after cart. Get the min page per session from the previous query
-- STEP 4 -- Join orders table to the cart and afer table
-- Step 5 -- Build the metrics, addding all the fields and then eliminating those that are not needed
